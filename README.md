I'm a producer/singer-songwriter(Song Example: [Check on YouTube](https://youtu.be/HMfoVSGNIHU?feature=shared), and I currently and mainly use [Ableton Live Suit](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/) to produce my songs with Audio-Plugins.
I'm currently learning Java in online course, and trying to learn by myself visual programming with [Pure Data](https://puredata.info/), [JUCE](https://juce.com/) and C++ to create Audio Plug-Ins, audio related things.
