I`m currently learning Java in the online course, and trying to learn visual programming with Pure Data, and C ++/Juce to create Audio Plug-Ins by myself.
I'm a producer(singer-songwriter) as well, and I use Ableton Live Suit to produce my songs.
My mother tongue is Japanese, and speak English and German as well(working on my Spanish slowly).
