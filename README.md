I`m currently learning Java in the online course, and trying to learn by myself(YouTube tutorials) visual programming with [Pure Data](https://puredata.info/), and [JUCE](https://juce.com/) to create Audio Plug-Ins.
I'm a producer(singer-songwriter), and I use [Ableton Live Suit](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/) to produce my songs.
My mother tongue is Japanese, and speak English and German as well(working on my Spanish slowly).
Reach me out via [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chizuru-nina-yamauchi-3772b4116/) or other social media! :)
